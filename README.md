# lean-metaprogramming

These are Lean slides that I used for a guest lecture at the Lean seminar for mathematics at the university of Amsterdam and the mastermath course "Formal Methods in Mathematics".

Running the slides (assuming an installation of Lean):

- Get the dependencies required for LeanSlides [see here](https://github.com/0art0/lean-slides) or just run `nix-shell` in this directory if you have [nix](https://nixos.org/).
- Run `lake run lean-slides/serve-slides` to serve the slides.
